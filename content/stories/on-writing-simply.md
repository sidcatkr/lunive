The blank page is honest. It asks only one thing of you: say something true, and say it clearly. Everything else — the flourishes, the nested clauses, the long throat-clearing introductions — is a kind of hiding.

Good writing begins with the decision to actually say something. Not to gesture at an idea while orbiting it indefinitely, but to land on it squarely and let the reader feel the weight of what you mean.

## The Temptation of Complexity

Writers, especially early in their development, mistake complexity for depth. They confuse long sentences with sophisticated thinking. But the inverse is usually true: the clearest writers have done the hardest cognitive work before touching the page.

Complexity in prose is easy. Clarity is the real achievement.

Consider a sentence like: *"The aforementioned considerations, when taken in aggregate, present a compelling argument for the reconsideration of established paradigms as they relate to the aforementioned subject matter."*

Compare it to: *"This changes everything."*

The first sentence says nothing. The second says it all.

## Cutting as Craft

Editing is not subtraction — it is revelation. Every word you remove makes the remaining words stronger. The best editors are not people who add; they are people who see what is already there and remove what obscures it.

Ernest Hemingway developed the "iceberg theory": only a fraction of the story appears on the surface, but the weight of everything beneath it is felt. Remove the unnecessary, and the necessary becomes powerful.

When you finish a draft, ask of every sentence: *does this earn its place?* Not "is this a good sentence?" — many good sentences have no business being in a given piece. Ask only: does this move the reader closer to the truth you are trying to express?

If the answer is no, cut it.

## Reading Aloud

The simplest diagnostic for bad writing is reading it aloud. A tangled sentence will trip you immediately. Redundant phrases will sound wrong before they look wrong. The rhythm of prose — the way sentences breathe — is audible before it is visible.

Writers who never read their work aloud are working half-blind. The ear catches what the eye misses because the eye has read the sentence you intended to write, not the sentence you actually wrote.

## The Long Game

Simple writing takes longer to produce than complex writing. There is no shortcut. You have to think through what you actually mean, reduce it to its essence, and then find the most direct path to expressing it.

But the payoff is lasting. A sentence that says exactly what it means, with no unnecessary parts, endures. The reader will not know why they trust you, but they will. Because clarity is a form of honesty, and readers recognize honesty even when they cannot name it.

Write clearly. Cut mercilessly. Read it aloud. Repeat.

[^2]: The "iceberg theory" appears in Hemingway's *Death in the Afternoon* (1932): "If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them."
